## Request

```
GET https://api.yelp.com/v3/businesses/search
```

## Parameters

These parameters should be in the query string.

| Name | Type | Description |
|:------|:------|:----------|
| term | string | Optional. Search term (e.g. "food", "restaurants"). If term isn’t included we search everything. The term keyword also accepts business names such as "Starbucks". |
| location | string | Required if either latitude or longitude is not provided. Specifies the combination of "address, neighborhood, city, state or zip, optional country" to be used when searching for businesses. |
| latitude | decimal | Required if location is not provided. Latitude of the location you want to search near by. |
| longitude | decimal | Required if location is not provided. Longitude of the location you want to search near by. |
| radius | int | Optional. Search radius in meters. If the value is too large, a AREA\_TOO\_LARGE error may be returned. The max value is 40000 meters (25 miles). |
| categories | string | Optional. Categories to filter the search results with. See the [list of supported categories](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/all_category_list). The category filter can be a list of comma delimited categories. For example, "bars,french" will filter by Bars and French. The category identifier should be used (for example "discgolf", not "Disc Golf"). |
| locale | string | Optional. Specify the locale to return the business information in. See the [list of supported locales](supported-locales.md). |
| limit | int | Optional. Number of business results to return. By default, it will return 20. |
| offset | int | Optional. Offset the list of returned business results by this amount. |
| sort_by | string | Optional. Sort the results by one of the these modes: best\_match, rating, review\_count or distance. By default it's best_match. The rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a bayesian average. This is so a business with 1 rating of 5 stars doesn’t immediately jump to the top. |
| pricing_filter | string | Optional. Pricing levels to filter the search result with: 1 = $, 2 = $$, 3 = $$$, 4 = $$$$. The pricing filter can be a list of comma delimited pricing levels. For example, "1, 2, 3" will filter the results to show the ones that are $, $$, or $$$. |
| open\_now\_filter | boolean | Optional. Default to false. When set to true, only return the businesses open now. |

> Note
> 
> Using the ``offset`` and ``limit`` parameters, you can get up to 1000 businesses from this endpoint if there are more than 1000 results. If you request a page out of this 1000 business limit, this endpoint will return an error.
